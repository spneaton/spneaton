- 👋 Hi, I’m @spneaton
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech and I'm trying to find areas to stick to right now. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, CSS, and Javascript with my sights set on Python, Mern, and C. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that someone would be willing to teach me and be patient with me. 
- 📫 You can reach via email at spneaton@outlook.com
